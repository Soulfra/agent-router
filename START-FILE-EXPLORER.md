# File Explorer - Quick Start

Your file explorer is ready! This lets you see all your git repos, GitHub connections, uncommitted changes, and more.

## Start the Server

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/CALOS_ROOT/agent-router
node router.js
```

## Open File Explorer

Once the server is running, open in your browser:

```
http://localhost:5001/file-explorer.html
```

## What You Can Do

### üìä Overview
- See all git repos on your Desktop
- Check which have GitHub remotes
- See uncommitted changes at a glance
- Quick stats (total repos, uncommitted changes)

### üîç Repo Analysis
Click any repo in the sidebar to see:
- Git status (branch, remote, changes)
- GitHub connection (if linked)
- Last commit info
- Uncommitted files list
- Warnings (no remote, unpushed commits, etc.)

### üîó GitHub Comparison
Click "Compare GitHub" to see:
- Which local repos match your GitHub account
- Which repos are local-only (not pushed)
- Which GitHub repos aren't cloned locally

### üöÄ Full Scan
Click "Full Scan" to find:
- All git repositories
- All package.json projects
- All CSS theme files
- All README files

## API Endpoints

The file explorer exposes these APIs:

- `GET /api/explorer/git` - Quick git repo scan
- `GET /api/explorer/scan` - Full desktop scan
- `GET /api/explorer/tree` - Directory tree
- `GET /api/explorer/analyze?path=...` - Deep repo analysis
- `GET /api/explorer/compare?username=Soulfra` - Compare with GitHub
- `GET /api/explorer/file?path=...` - Read file contents
- `GET /api/explorer/diff?repo=...` - Get git diff
- `GET /api/explorer/history?repo=...` - Commit history
- `GET /api/explorer/summary` - Quick summary

## Your Situation

Based on the scan, here's what you have:

**CALOS_ROOT/agent-router**
- ‚ùå NO remote configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 100+ untracked files (including portfolio docs)
- üìù 37+ modified files
- ‚û°Ô∏è This needs a GitHub remote!

**Document-Generator**
- ‚úÖ Has remote: https://github.com/Soulfra/document-generator-mvp
- üìÇ Contains clean-portfolio (no git)

**document-generator-v2**
- ‚úÖ Has remote: https://github.com/Soulfra/document-generator-v2

**clean-portfolio** (Desktop)
- ‚ùå Empty directory (no git)

## Next Steps

1. **Start the server** and open file-explorer.html
2. **Click repos** to see their status
3. **Compare with GitHub** to see what's missing
4. **Decide** which repos need remotes, commits, or cleanup

## The Chaos Visualized

You'll finally SEE:
- What has git, what doesn't
- What's connected to GitHub, what isn't
- What has uncommitted changes
- Where all your projects actually are

No more blind navigation!
