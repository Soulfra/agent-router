# Database Status Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-22 17:08

## ✅ System Status: WORKING

Your PostgreSQL database is **fully operational** and being used by all systems.

### Current Configuration

```
Database Type:    PostgreSQL
Database Name:    calos
Host:             localhost:5432
User:             matthewmauer
Tables:           447
Migrations:       139 applied
Backup:           ✅ backups/calos-working-state.sql (2.0MB)
```

## What We Fixed

### ❌ Before
- 138 migration files, but 139 applied (confusing)
- Two migration directories (`database/migrations/` + `/migrations/`)
- Duplicate migration numbers (46 conflicts)
- Auto-migrator scanning both directories
- Hard to understand what migrations do

### ✅ After
- Clear documentation of 139 applied migrations
- Auto-migrator only scans `database/migrations/`
- Migration guide for new migrations (start at 140)
- Backup created as safety net
- Audit document explains everything

## Key Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MIGRATION-AUDIT.md` | Complete audit of all 138 migrations |
| `database/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` | How to create new migrations |
| `backups/calos-working-state.sql` | Full database backup (2.0MB) |
| `backups/applied-migrations-snapshot.txt` | List of 139 applied migrations |
| `scripts/renumber-migrations.js` | Tool to renumber if needed (not used) |

## What About SQLite?

- ✅ **One SQLite database:** `data/oauth-processing.db`
- ✅ **Purpose:** Local logs for OAuth screenshot processing
- ✅ **No conflict:** SQLite used for ephemeral data, PostgreSQL for everything else
- ❌ **No Prisma:** Not installed, not used anywhere

## Learning System Tables

Your CAL learning system is using PostgreSQL:

```sql
-- Core learning tables (from migration 020)
learning_paths         -- Learning tracks
lessons               -- Individual lessons
lesson_completions    -- What Cal completed
user_progress         -- XP, levels, streaks
```

**These tables exist and are being used RIGHT NOW.**

## Next Migration

When you need to add a new feature:

```bash
# Create migration file
touch database/migrations/140_add_your_feature.sql

# Write SQL
echo "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS your_table ..." > database/migrations/140_add_your_feature.sql

# Run migration
node database/run-migrations.js
```

See full guide: `database/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md`

## Database Schema Highlights

```
Users & Auth:
  users, user_sessions, api_keys

Learning System:
  learning_paths, lessons, lesson_completions, user_progress

Skills & Progress:
  skills, user_skills, achievements

Actions & Effects:
  action_definitions, effect_definitions

Content:
  lessons, learning_paths, app_templates

Analytics:
  agent_activity_log, api_usage, analytics_*

Plus 430+ other tables for various features
```

## Common Operations

### Backup database

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U matthewmauer calos > backups/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
```

### View tables

```bash
psql -h localhost -U matthewmauer -d calos -c "\dt"
```

### Check migrations

```bash
node database/run-migrations.js --status
```

### Restore backup

```bash
psql -h localhost -U matthewmauer -d calos < backups/calos-working-state.sql
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Relation does not exist"

The table might be in a migration that hasn't run yet. Check:

```bash
psql -d calos -c "\dt table_name"
```

### "Migration already exists"

This is fine. The migration was already applied. Check:

```bash
psql -d calos -c "SELECT * FROM migration_history WHERE migration_name LIKE '%your_migration%';"
```

### Server won't start

Check PostgreSQL is running:

```bash
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432
```

## Summary

✅ **PostgreSQL working locally**
✅ **All learning tables exist**
✅ **139 migrations applied**
✅ **Backup created**
✅ **Auto-migrator simplified**
✅ **Migration guide created**
✅ **No Prisma confusion**
✅ **SQLite only for local logs**

**Bottom line:** Your database is working. The migration mess was organizational, not functional. Now it's documented and simplified for future work.
