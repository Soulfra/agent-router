## COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Can we deploy this today?"
**A:** "Yes. Three options:"
1. Web (browser) - `npm start` âœ… **Working now**
2. iOS (iPhone app) - `npm run ios:open` âœ… **Configured, needs Xcode**
3. PWA (installable) - Add to home screen âœ… **Works now**

**Production deployment:**
- Vercel: `npx vercel` (2 minutes)
- DigitalOcean: Upload + `npm start`
- Your server: Point DNS, run `pm2 start router.js`

---

### Q: "How do customers use this?"
**A:** "Enterprise white-label model:"

```
Customer buys license
  â†“
Deploy on their domain (e.g., customer.com)
  â†“
License phones home to verify
  â†“
We track their usage (telemetry)
  â†“
Culture Analyzer finds upsell opportunities
  â†“
We see: "Customer hit 95% of API limit, high priority upgrade"
```

**This is the Unity/Unreal Engine model** - not SaaS, enterprise licensing.

---

### Q: "What about data/customers?"
**A:** "Two modes:"

**API Mode (current):**
- No database needed
- Perfect for demos
- All UI works
