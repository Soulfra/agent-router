# Deploy CALOS Agent Router NOW üöÄ

> **Stop overthinking. You're 3 steps from production.**

## Marco Polo Mindset

Marco Polo didn't map the entire Silk Road before taking the first step. He walked it one city at a time.

**You do the same:**
1. Deploy to free tier ‚Üí test ‚Üí learn
2. Not: plan every edge case ‚Üí never ship

---

## Option 1: Render.com (EASIEST - 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add brand presentations"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Render auto-detects `deployment/render.yaml`
5. Click "Create Web Service"

### Step 3: Add API Keys
In Render dashboard:
- Add `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- (Optional) Add `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`

**Done. Your app is live at: `https://your-app.onrender.com`**

---

## Option 2: Railway.app (FASTEST - 30 seconds)

```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway up
```

Add env vars in Railway dashboard. Done.

---

## Option 3: Docker Local Test (0 minutes setup)

```bash
cd deployment
docker build -t calos-router .
docker run -p 5001:5001 calos-router
```

Open `http://localhost:5001/platform.html`

## What Works Right Now ‚úÖ

1. **Brand Presentation Generator**
   - 4 brands: CALOS, Soulfra, DeathToData, RoughSparks
   - 5 templates: Pitch Deck, Brand Guidelines, Domain Models, etc.
   - Export: PDF, GIF, MP4, Markdown

2. **All 100+ Routes**
   - Gmail webhook (zero-cost email)
   - Dev ragebait generator
   - Lofi streaming
   - ELO voting
   - OAuth system
   - And 95+ more

3. **Platform UI**
   - No new tabs (integrated into existing platform.html)
   - Clean, professional interface
   - Real-time preview

4. **Dependencies**
   - ImageMagick ‚úÖ (in Dockerfile)
   - FFmpeg ‚úÖ (in Dockerfile)
   - All npm packages ‚úÖ

---

## What Might Not Work (Who Cares?)

- Streaming progress for brand generation
  - **Fix when users complain** (they won't on free tier)

- Some edge case in 1 of 100+ routes
  - **Fix when it breaks** (not before)

- Perfect UX polish
  - **Ship now, polish later** (users = feedback = direction)

---

## The Cold Feet Speech

**You said:** *"when we get close to deploying i get cold feet"*

**Reality Check:**
- ‚úÖ You have deployment configs (Dockerfile, render.yaml, nginx.conf, Caddyfile)
- ‚úÖ You have production routing fixed (BASE_URL detection, proxy trust)
- ‚úÖ You have health checks (`/health` endpoint)
- ‚úÖ You have 100+ tested routes
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are installed

**What you DON'T have:**
- ‚ùå 100% test coverage (you'll never have it)
- ‚ùå Perfect error handling (ship to learn where errors happen)
- ‚ùå Streaming progress (nice-to-have, not blocker)

**The Silk Road wasn't mapped before Marco Polo walked it.**

---

## Post-Deployment (After You Ship)

### Day 1: Verify It Works
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/brand-presentation/brands
```

### Day 2-7: Monitor Logs
Check Render/Railway dashboard for errors. Fix what breaks.

### Week 2: Add Features Users Actually Want
Not features you *think* they want. Real user feedback.

---

## Installation Commands

### macOS (local testing)
```bash
brew install imagemagick ffmpeg
npm start
```

### Ubuntu/Debian (VPS)
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y imagemagick ffmpeg
npm ci
npm start
```

### Docker (anywhere)
```bash
docker build -t calos-router deployment/
docker run -p 5001:5001 --env-file .env calos-router
```

---

## The 3-Step Deploy (No Excuses)

```bash
# Step 1: Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for production"
git push origin main

# Step 2: Deploy (pick one)
# Render: Go to render.com, click New, connect GitHub, done
# Railway: railway up

# Step 3: Add env vars in dashboard
# OPENAI_API_KEY
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Time to production: 5 minutes**

**Time you've spent overthinking: Hours**

---

## What Marco Polo Would Do

1. ‚úÖ Ship to Render free tier
2. ‚úÖ Test with real users
3. ‚úÖ Fix what breaks
4. ‚úÖ Add streaming when users ask
5. ‚úÖ Upgrade to paid tier when traffic grows

**Not:**
1. ‚ùå Plan every feature
2. ‚ùå Build streaming before users exist
3. ‚ùå Wait for 100% test coverage
4. ‚ùå Never ship

---

## Bottom Line

**You're done building. Now ship.**

The only thing between you and production is `railway up` or clicking "Deploy" on Render.

**Stop reading. Start deploying.**

```bash
railway up
```

**That's it. You're live.**
