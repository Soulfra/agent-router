# CalOS Learning Hub - Deployment Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Local Database Connection
- ✅ Server now connects to PostgreSQL when started with `--local` flag
- ✅ Fixed SQL schema mismatch (`status` column instead of `active`)
- ✅ Learning API endpoints working locally: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/learning/paths`
- ✅ Returns "Debugging Mastery" learning path with 10 lessons

**Test:**
```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/CALOS_ROOT/agent-router
node router.js --local
curl http://localhost:5001/api/learning/paths
```

### 2. Fixed GitHub Pages Redirect Issue ✅ WORKING
- ✅ Removed `CNAME` file that was redirecting soulfra.github.io to cringeproof.com
- ✅ Backed up as `CNAME.backup` for future custom domain setup
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ **GitHub Pages rebuild complete - now returns HTTP 200**

**Test:**
```bash
curl -I https://soulfra.github.io/learn/
# ✅ Returns: HTTP/2 200 (no more redirect!)
```

### 3. Updated Router.js for Production Deployment
- ✅ Auto-detects `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (Railway/production)
- ✅ Falls back to individual DB params for local development
- ✅ Added SSL support for Railway PostgreSQL
- ✅ CORS already configured to accept all origins

**Changes made:**
- `router.js:55` - Auto-enable database mode when `DATABASE_URL` exists
- `router.js:1344-1361` - Use `DATABASE_URL` connection string with SSL for production

### 4. Created Database Export Scripts
- ✅ Full schema export: `railway-db-export/schema.sql`
- ✅ Learning data export: `railway-db-export/learning_data.sql`
- ✅ Import script: `railway-db-export/import-to-railway.sh`

**Run export:**
```bash
./scripts/export-db-for-railway.sh
```

### 5. Created Automated Deployment Script
- ✅ `deploy-to-railway.sh` - One-command deployment
- ✅ Handles Railway login, project creation, PostgreSQL setup
- ✅ Auto-exports database and deploys code
- ✅ Tests API endpoint after deployment

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

You can now deploy to Railway with a single command:

```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/CALOS_ROOT/agent-router
./deploy-to-railway.sh
```

**Or follow manual steps in RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**

## 📊 Architecture Overview

### Before (Broken)
```
Frontend (GitHub Pages)
   ↓ Redirects to cringeproof.com (HTTP 301) ❌
❌ Can't reach learning hub

Backend API
   ↓ Requires --local flag
❌ api.calos.dev doesn't exist
```

### Now (Fixed Local + Frontend)
```
Frontend (GitHub Pages)
   ✅ https://soulfra.github.io/learn/ (HTTP 200)
   ↓ (tries to fetch)
❌ api.calos.dev (still doesn't exist)

Backend (Local)
   ✅ localhost:5001 --local
   ✅ PostgreSQL connected
   ✅ /api/learning/paths working
```

### After Railway Deployment
```
Frontend (GitHub Pages)
   ✅ https://soulfra.github.io/learn/
   ↓ HTTPS
✅ Railway (your-url.up.railway.app)
   ↓ DATABASE_URL
✅ PostgreSQL (Railway addon)
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. **Deploy to Railway:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-to-railway.sh
   ```

2. **Get Railway URL** from output (e.g., `https://calos-api-production.up.railway.app`)

3. **Update frontend API URL:**
   - Edit `projects/soulfra.github.io/learn/index.html`
   - Change `API_BASE` to your Railway URL
   - Commit and push to GitHub

4. **Test live site:**
   ```bash
   open https://soulfra.github.io/learn/
   ```

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment tutorial
- ✅ `deploy-to-railway.sh` - Automated deployment script
- ✅ `scripts/export-db-for-railway.sh` - Database export script
- ✅ `railway-db-export/` - Database exports folder
  - `schema.sql` - Full database structure
  - `learning_data.sql` - Learning paths + lessons data
  - `essential_data.sql` - Users, sessions, etc.
  - `import-to-railway.sh` - Import script for Railway
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- ✅ `router.js` - Lines 55, 1344-1361 (Railway DATABASE_URL support)
- ✅ `lib/learning-engine.js` - Line 845 (fixed SQL: `status` not `active`)
- ✅ `projects/soulfra.github.io/CNAME` → Renamed to `CNAME.backup`

## 🎉 Working Components

1. ✅ Local server with database: `node router.js --local`
2. ✅ Learning API endpoint: `/api/learning/paths`
3. ✅ GitHub Pages accessible: soulfra.github.io/learn/ (no redirect)
4. ✅ Database export ready for Railway
5. ✅ Router.js ready for production deployment

## ⏭️ Remaining Work

1. ⏳ Login to Railway: `railway login`
2. ⏳ Deploy backend: `./deploy-to-railway.sh`
3. ⏳ Update frontend API URL
4. ⏳ Push frontend changes to GitHub

**Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes
