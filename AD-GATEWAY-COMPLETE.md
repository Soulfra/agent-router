## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

#### 1. Commission (Primary)
- **Default:** 25% of conversion revenue
- Agency converts $10,000 → You get $2,500
- **No risk:** Only pay on results

#### 2. API Markup (When Using Your Keys)
- **Rate:** 50% markup on AI API costs
- Client query costs $0.10 → You charge $0.15
- Profit: $0.05 per query

#### 3. Platform Fee (Subscription)
- **Tier 1:** $500/month (self-service)
- **Tier 2:** $2,000/month (managed)
- **Tier 3:** $5,000/month (white-label)

## Next Steps

### To Launch (Complete the Platform)

#### 1. Wire Routes into Router (5 min)
```javascript
// router.js - Add after Triangle routes initialization
const { initRoutes: initCampaignRoutes } = require('./routes/campaign-routes');
const CampaignManager = require('./lib/campaign-manager');

let campaignManager = new CampaignManager({
  db,
  experimentManager,
  affiliateTracker,
  multiProviderRouter,
  triangleEngine
});

let campaignRoutes = initCampaignRoutes(db, campaignManager);
app.use('/api', campaignRoutes);
```

#### 2. Run Migration (1 min)
```bash
# Migration will run automatically on next server start
node router.js --local

# Or manually:
psql -d calos < database/migrations/140_ad_gateway_campaigns.sql
```

#### 3. Create Simple UI (1 hour)
- Landing page: `/ad-gateway`
- Campaign creator: Simple form
- Dashboard: Show performance
- **Optional:** Can start with API-only

#### 4. Test With One Client (1 day)
```bash
# Create test campaign
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/campaigns \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: 1" \
  -d '{
    "campaign_name": "Test Campaign",
    "budget_cents": 100000,
    "target_vertical": "crypto",
    "ad_copy": "Trade smarter with AI",
    "landing_page_url": "https://example.com",

  }'

# Check performance
