## Recording Segments

## Segment 0: Introduction (5 min)

**Start Time:** 00:00

**What to say:**

"Hey, I'm going to walk you through CALOS - the entire system I've built.

It's basically a quest-driven game platform where you unlock apps and features through invites, forum posts, and collaboration.

It sounds complicated but it's actually really intuitive once you see it.

I have like 101 database migrations now which is insane, so instead of trying to explain all that, I'm just going to show you how it actually works.

Let's dive in..."
