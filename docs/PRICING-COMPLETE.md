**Free Tier:**
- Community: 5/month

- Pro: Infinity (still charged per transaction)
- Enterprise: Infinity (still charged per transaction)

**Example:**
- 500 transactions/mo @ $50 avg = $25,000 processed
- Fee: ($25,000 × 0.026) + (500 × $0.10) = $650 + $50 = **$700/mo**

**vs Square:**
- Square: Same rate (2.6% + $0.10)

**Free Tier:**
- Community: 0 (must upgrade to Pro/Enterprise)
- Pro: Infinity (still charged per charge)
- Enterprise: Infinity (still charged per charge)

**Example:**
- 10 crypto charges/mo @ $100 avg = $1,000 processed

## License Verification

CALOS uses a **"phone home"** license verification system (like VS Code, Unity):

### How It Works

```
1. You deploy CALOS to example.com
2. CALOS detects it's not localhost
3. CALOS calls license.calos.sh/verify with:
   - Domain: example.com
   - Install ID: abc123...
   - Usage stats (anonymized)
   - Routes (your custom API endpoints)
   - Themes (marketplace themes you use)
4. License server responds with:
   - Tier: pro
   - Features: whiteLabel=true, apiAccess=true
   - Valid: true
5. CALOS caches the result for 7 days (Pro tier)
```

**Verification Intervals:**
- Development: No verification
- Community: Every 24 hours
- Pro: Every 7 days
- Enterprise: Every 30 days

**Graceful Degradation:**
- License server down? 24h grace period
- After grace period? Warning banner (still works)
- **NEVER fully disables** (unlike Unity)

**What We Collect:**
- Domain name (example.com)
- Install ID (unique identifier)
- Usage stats (anonymized, no PII)
- Custom routes (user's API endpoints)
- Installed themes (marketplace themes)
- Telemetry data (feature usage, performance, errors)

**What We DON'T Collect:**
- ❌ User emails
- ❌ Customer data
- ❌ Transaction amounts
- ❌ QuickBooks data
- ❌ Transcript contents
- ❌ IP addresses (country-level only)

See `docs/LICENSE-SYSTEM.md` for technical details.

---

## Telemetry & Privacy

### What We Collect

CALOS collects **anonymized telemetry** (like VS Code, GitHub, Google Analytics):

1. **Feature Usage**: Which features are used, how often
2. **Performance Metrics**: API response times, slow requests
3. **Session Analytics**: Active sessions, duration
4. **Error Reporting**: Exceptions, API errors (obfuscated)
5. **Trend Analysis**: Popular themes, common workflows

### What We DON'T Collect

- ❌ Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- ❌ Email addresses, names, phone numbers
- ❌ IP addresses (country-level only)
- ❌ Transaction amounts, customer data
- ❌ QuickBooks data, credit card numbers
- ❌ Transcript contents, forum posts, contract details

### Privacy & Obfuscation

All data is obfuscated before transmission:

```javascript
// User IDs
"user_abc123" → "f3a2b1c0d4e5f6a7" (SHA-256 hash)

// Email Addresses
"john.doe@gmail.com" → "gmail.com" (domain only)

// URL Paths
"/api/users/123/transactions/abc-def-456" → "/api/users/:id/transactions/:id"

// Error Messages
"User john.doe@gmail.com not found" → "User [EMAIL] not found"

// Stack Traces
50-line stack trace → First 5 lines only, PII removed
```

### Telemetry by Tier

| Tier | Telemetry | Can Opt-Out? |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Development** (localhost) | ❌ None | N/A |
| **Community** | ✅ Required | ❌ No (in TOS) |
| **Pro** | ✅ Required | ❌ No (in TOS) |
| **Enterprise** | ✅ Optional | ✅ Yes (air-gapped) |
| **Self-Hosted** | ✅ Optional | ✅ Yes |

### Opt-Out (Enterprise Only)

Enterprise users can disable telemetry:

```bash
# .env
TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true  # Air-gapped mode
```

See `docs/TELEMETRY-SYSTEM.md` for complete details.
