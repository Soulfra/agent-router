## Patent Applications

### 1. License Verification System (Patent Pending)

**Application No.**: US XX/XXX,XXX (filed 2024-XX-XX)

**Title**: "Graceful Degradation License Verification for Distributed Software Systems"

**Abstract:**
A method and system for verifying software licenses in distributed environments without disrupting critical business operations. The system employs a "phone home" architecture with multi-tiered caching, grace periods, and graceful degradation to ensure business continuity even during license server outages.

**Key Claims:**
1. Method for verifying software licenses with tiered verification intervals based on subscription tier (24h, 7d, 30d)
2. System for caching license verification results with graceful degradation
3. Telemetry collection integrated with license verification (batched transmission)
4. Multi-domain license management with domain detection
5. Air-gapped mode for enterprise customers with manual verification

**Advantages Over Prior Art:**
- **vs Flexera/SafeNet**: Graceful degradation (never fully disables)
- **vs Unity**: Fair warning system (24h grace period)
- **vs Adobe**: Tier-based verification intervals (not one-size-fits-all)

**Commercial Applications:**
- SaaS license management
- Enterprise software licensing
- Open-source monetization
- Business operating systems

---

### 2. Usage-Based Pricing Calculator (Patent Pending)

**Application No.**: US XX/XXX,XXX (filed 2024-XX-XX)

**Title**: "Dynamic Usage-Based Pricing Calculator with Real-Time Tier Recommendation"

**Abstract:**
An interactive pricing calculator that dynamically recommends subscription tiers based on usage patterns, calculates exact costs including transaction fees, and provides competitor comparison in real-time. The system employs slider-based input with instant feedback and tier optimization algorithms.

**Key Claims:**
1. Real-time pricing calculation based on multiple usage metrics (transcripts, POS transactions, crypto charges, locations, API requests)
2. Automatic tier recommendation algorithm based on usage patterns and limits
3. Competitor savings calculator comparing multiple pricing models
4. Interactive slider interface with instant pricing feedback
5. Transparent pricing breakdown showing all cost components

**Advantages Over Prior Art:**
- **vs Stripe Pricing**: Multi-metric optimization (not just payment volume)
- **vs AWS Calculator**: Tier recommendation (not just cost estimation)
- **vs Shopify Pricing**: Competitor comparison built-in

**Commercial Applications:**
- SaaS pricing pages
- Usage-based billing systems
- Enterprise software pricing
- Multi-tier subscription models

### 3. Fair Trade Pricing Model (Patent Pending)

**Application No.**: US XX/XXX,XXX (filed 2024-XX-XX)

**Title**: "Fair Trade Pricing System for Software Services with Data, Payment, or Contribution Options"

**Abstract:**
A novel pricing model that allows users to contribute value through multiple channels: anonymized data sharing (telemetry), monetary payment (subscriptions), or community contributions (code, documentation, themes). The system dynamically adjusts pricing tiers and feature access based on user's chosen contribution method.

**Key Claims:**
1. Three-option value contribution system (data OR money OR credit)
2. Telemetry-based pricing discount with privacy-preserving data collection
3. Community contribution credit system with marketplace integration
4. Dynamic tier assignment based on contribution value
5. Fair trade verification with contribution tracking

**Advantages Over Prior Art:**
- **vs Freemium Models**: Multiple value contribution paths (not just payment)
- **vs Open Source**: Sustainable monetization (not just donations)
- **vs Data Brokers**: Privacy-first data collection (obfuscated, no PII)

**Commercial Applications:**

**Abstract:**
A comprehensive telemetry system that collects usage data, performance metrics, and error reports while preserving user privacy through obfuscation techniques. The system allows tier-based opt-out (Enterprise/Self-Hosted) while maintaining data utility for analytics.

**Key Claims:**
1. Multi-layer data obfuscation (SHA-256 hashing, PII removal, URL parameterization)
2. Batched transmission integrated with license verification
3. Tier-based telemetry collection (required for Community/Pro, optional for Enterprise)
4. Privacy-preserving error tracking with stack trace sanitization
5. Localhost detection with automatic telemetry disabling

**Advantages Over Prior Art:**
- **vs Google Analytics**: Tier-based opt-out (not all-or-nothing)
- **vs VS Code Telemetry**: Integrated with license verification
- **vs Sentry**: Privacy obfuscation built-in (not opt-in)

**Commercial Applications:**
- SaaS analytics
- Error tracking systems
