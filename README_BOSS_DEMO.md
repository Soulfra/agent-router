# 🎯 READY TO IMPRESS YOUR BOSS

**Everything is working. Here's what to do:**

```bash
# 1. Start the server
npm start

# 2. Test it works
curl http://localhost:5001

# 3. Open demo in your browser
npm run demo
```

**What happens:**
- Server starts on port 5001

2. **Enterprise Dashboard** - "This manages all our customers"
   - `npm run demo:enterprise`

3. **CALOS OS** - "This is the full operating system"
   - `npm run demo:calos`

4. **Mobile Demo** - "And it works on your iPhone right now"
   - See **[IPHONE_INSTALL.md](./IPHONE_INSTALL.md)**

5. **The Close** - "We have 79 apps, ready to deploy in 2 minutes"
   - `./scripts/launch.sh list`
