## Method 1: Add to Home Screen (PWA)

### Step 1: Open in Safari
1. Make sure your Mac server is running: `npm start`
2. Find your Mac's IP address:
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Example output: `192.168.1.87`

3. On your iPhone, open **Safari** (must be Safari, not Chrome)
4. Go to: `http://YOUR_IP:5001/soulfra-os.html`
   - Replace `YOUR_IP` with the IP from step 2
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.87:5001/soulfra-os.html`

### Step 2: Add to Home Screen
1. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow pointing up)
2. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. Name it: "SoulFra OS" (or whatever you want)
4. Tap **"Add"** (top right)

### Step 3: Done!
- You now have an app icon on your home screen
- It opens in full-screen (no Safari bars)
- It works offline (if service worker is enabled)
- It looks exactly like a native app

## Method 2: QR Code (Super Fast)

### On your Mac:
```bash
# Make sure server is running

# Generate QR code

```

### On your iPhone:
1. Open Camera app
2. Point at QR code on your Mac screen

## Production (Access from Anywhere)

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel (Free, 5 minutes)
```bash
npx vercel
```

**Result:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`

Now you can install it from anywhere:
1. Open `https://your-app.vercel.app/soulfra-os.html` on iPhone
2. Add to Home Screen
3. Works worldwide (not just on WiFi)

### Option B: Use Your Domain
If you have a domain (e.g., `soulfra.com`):
1. Point DNS to your server IP
2. iPhone users visit `https://soulfra.com`
3. Add to Home Screen
4. Share the URL with customers

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect from iPhone
**Problem:** "Safari can't open the page"

**Fix:**
1. Check Mac and iPhone are on same WiFi
2. Check Mac firewall:
   - System Settings â†’ Network â†’ Firewall
   - Turn off or allow incoming connections
3. Verify server is running: `curl http://localhost:5001`
4. Try IP again: `ifconfig | grep "inet "`

### IP address changes
**Problem:** IP keeps changing

**Fix (temporary static IP):**
1. System Settings â†’ Network â†’ WiFi â†’ Details
2. TCP/IP â†’ Configure IPv4 â†’ Manually
3. Set IP: `192.168.1.87` (or any free IP)
4. Subnet: `255.255.255.0`
5. Router: Your router IP (usually `192.168.1.1`)

**Or just redeploy to Vercel (permanent URL)**

### App doesn't work offline
**Problem:** Loses connection when WiFi off

**Currently:** Server must be running (localhost mode)

**To enable offline:**
1. Deploy to production (Vercel/AWS)
2. Add service worker (already configured in manifest.json)
3. Now works offline

## Advanced: Custom App Icon

### Step 1: Create Icon Image
1. Create 512x512 PNG image
2. Save as `/Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/CALOS_ROOT/agent-router/public/icon-512.png`

### Step 2: Update Manifest
Already configured in `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png",
      "purpose": "any maskable"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Add to Home Screen
Now when you "Add to Home Screen", it uses your custom icon!

## Why This Is Better Than App Store

| App Store | PWA (Add to Home Screen) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year) | Free |
| 7-14 day review process | Instant |
| Can be rejected | No approval needed |
| Updates need review | Update instantly |
| Limited to iOS | Works on Android too |
| Native app size (50MB+) | Lightweight (loads from web) |

**You get 80% of native app experience with 0% of the hassle.**

## Next Steps

### For Boss Demo:
1. âœ… Install on your iPhone (5 minutes)
2. âœ… Show him the icon on your home screen
3. âœ… Open the app full-screen
4. ðŸš€ Impress him

### For Production:
1. Deploy to Vercel: `npx vercel`
2. Get URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
3. Share with customers
4. They install via "Add to Home Screen"
5. You have an "app" without App Store

### For Full Native App (Later):
```bash
# Build iOS app (requires Xcode + Mac)
npm run ios:sync
npm run ios:open
# Click Play in Xcode â†’ Run on iPhone
```

**But honestly, PWA is good enough for 90% of use cases.**
