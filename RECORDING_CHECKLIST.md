## During Recording

### Pacing
- Speak clearly and naturally (don't rush)
- Pause between segments (easier to edit)
- If you mess up, just pause and restart that sentence
- You can edit out mistakes later

### Audio Quality Tips
- Don't touch/move phone during recording
- Avoid paper rustling near mic
- Minimize keyboard/mouse clicks if possible
- Speak at consistent volume

### Content Tips
- Follow the walkthrough sequence loosely (not rigidly)
- Show, don't just tell (demonstrate features)
- Explain WHY things matter, not just WHAT they do
- Be yourself - natural beats perfect

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't aim for perfection** - Authentic > polished
2. **Edit later** - Just keep talking, fix mistakes in post
3. **Show the journey** - Explain your thinking, not just the code
4. **Be enthusiastic** - Your excitement is contagious
5. **Take breaks** - Record in segments if needed

**Ready? Hit record and start with Segment 0 (Introduction)!**
