# Process & Network Monitoring - Status Update

**Date:** 2025-10-22

## ✅ Completed: Process Monitoring

### What Works Now

1. **Process Management Routes** - Mounted in router.js (line 1899-1912)
   - API working at `http://localhost:5001/api/processes`
   - Stats endpoint: `GET /api/processes/stats` ✅
   - Analyze endpoint: `GET /api/processes/analyze` ✅
   - Track, kill, cleanup endpoints all working

2. **Background Job Tracking**
   - ShellProcessManager running (check interval: 5s)
   - ProcessMiningAnalyzer active
   - Auto-cleanup enabled

3. **Dashboard Available**
   - URL: `http://localhost:5001/process-monitor.html`
   - Auto-refreshes every 5s
   - Shows running/completed/failed/stuck processes

### Test Commands

```bash
# Test API
curl http://localhost:5001/api/processes/stats
# → {"success":true,"stats":{"total":0,"running":0,...}}

# Open dashboard
open http://localhost:5001/process-monitor.html
```

## 🚧 In Progress: Network Traffic Radar

### What You Wanted

**User request:** "can we somehow tie it into our ip or router and see the traffic and where its coming from etc? or whatever the fuck is going on? even internally that could be cool **almost like a radar**"

### The Plan

**Network traffic monitoring like a radar** - track all incoming/outgoing connections:
- WHO is connecting (IP addresses)
- WHERE from (geolocation)
- WHAT they're hitting (endpoints, paths)
- HOW MUCH bandwidth (bytes in/out)
- Internal vs external traffic
- Real-time visual radar

**Pattern:** Like Wireshark, netstat, router admin panel, firewall logs

### Files to Create

1. **lib/network-traffic-monitor.js**
   - Track all HTTP requests (IP, port, path, user-agent)
   - Track active connections (like `netstat -an`)
   - Track bandwidth (bytes in/out per IP)
   - Detect suspicious activity (rapid requests, port scanning)

2. **lib/network-analytics.js**
   - Traffic patterns analysis
   - Geographic distribution
   - Popular endpoints
   - Suspicious patterns

3. **routes/network-radar-routes.js**
   - API endpoints for radar
   - `/api/network/connections` - Active connections
   - `/api/network/traffic` - Traffic stats
   - `/api/network/bandwidth` - Bandwidth usage
   - `/api/network/suspicious` - Suspicious activity

4. **public/network-radar.html**
   - **Visual radar display** (like your idea)
   - Real-time connection map
   - Active connections table (IP, location, endpoint)
   - Bandwidth graph
   - Auto-refresh every 2s

5. **Integration with CalRivenPersona**
   - `queryNetworkTraffic()` - Get traffic report
   - `detectSuspiciousTraffic()` - Find DoS, port scanning
   - Network awareness like process awareness

### Example Output (The Radar)

```
       🌐 NETWORK RADAR

       Active Connections: 15

    External (12)              Internal (3)
         ↓                          ↓
   45.67.123.45              192.168.1.100
   [San Francisco]           [Your Laptop]
        ↓                          ↓
      :5001/api              :5001/dashboard
        ↓                          ↓
    [SERVER]                  [SERVER]
        ↓                          ↓
   92.14.56.78               127.0.0.1
   [London, UK]              [Localhost]

Bandwidth:
├─ 45.67.123.45: 2.3 MB in, 15.7 MB out
├─ 192.168.1.100: 500 KB in, 1.2 MB out
└─ 127.0.0.1: 100 KB in, 50 KB out

⚠️ ALERTS:
- IP 45.67.123.45: 100 req/min (possible DoS)
```

### Implementation Approach

**1. Middleware for Request Tracking**
```javascript
// Intercept all HTTP requests
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const ip = req.ip || req.connection.remoteAddress;
  const path = req.path;
  const userAgent = req.get('user-agent');

  networkMonitor.trackRequest({ ip, path, userAgent, timestamp: Date.now() });

  next();
});
```

**2. Active Connection Tracking**
```javascript
// Use netstat-like tracking
const activeConnections = await exec('netstat -an | grep :5001');
// Parse and display
```

**3. Bandwidth Monitoring**
```javascript
// Track bytes sent/received per IP
class NetworkTrafficMonitor {
  async trackBandwidth(ip, bytesIn, bytesOut) {
    // Accumulate per IP
  }
}
```

**4. Geo Location**
```javascript
// Use free geolocation API
const geoInfo = await fetch(`http://ip-api.com/json/${ip}`);
// → { city: "San Francisco", country: "United States" }
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. Create `lib/network-traffic-monitor.js`
2. Add middleware to router.js to intercept requests
3. Create API endpoints for traffic data
4. Build visual radar dashboard

### Testing

```bash
# Generate some traffic
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:5001/api/processes/stats

# Check radar
open http://localhost:5001/network-radar.html

# Should see:
# - Your IP (internal)
# - Requests to /health, /api/processes/stats
# - Bandwidth usage
# - Real-time updates
```

## Why This Is Useful

1. **Security** - Detect DoS attacks, port scanning, brute force
2. **Monitoring** - See who's using your API, from where
3. **Debug** - Track internal vs external traffic
4. **Analytics** - Popular endpoints, geographic distribution
5. **Awareness** - CalRiven knows who's connecting

## DevOps Patterns

**Like:**
- Wireshark (packet inspection)
- `netstat -an` (active connections)
- Router admin panel (connected devices, bandwidth)
- Firewall logs (who's hitting what)
- Google Analytics (but for network traffic)

**Visual radar idea** - Perfect for real-time connection monitoring!

## Current Status

**Process Monitoring:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Dashboard: http://localhost:5001/process-monitor.html
- API: http://localhost:5001/api/processes/*

**Network Radar:** 🚧 READY TO BUILD
- Design complete
- Implementation plan ready
- Will add visual radar as requested

**Process monitoring works. Network radar coming next.** 🎯
