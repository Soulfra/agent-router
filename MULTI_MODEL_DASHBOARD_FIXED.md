# Multi-Model Research Dashboard - Fixed ‚úÖ

**Date:** 2025-10-22

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå "Failed to fetch" Error - FIXED
**Problem:** Route path mismatch
- HTML was calling: `/api/multi-model/compare`
- Actual route was: `/api/models/compare`

**Solution:** Updated fetch URL in HTML to match existing route

### 2. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Licensing & Attribution - ADDED
**Problem:** Users didn't understand what this is or the licensing implications

**Solution:** Added comprehensive info section with:
- "What is this?" explainer (research sandbox like Google AI Studio)
- How it works (step-by-step breakdown)
- Licensing notice for each AI model (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc.)
- Privacy & security details (own browser, no tracking, encrypted)
- Example queries to get started

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Error Handling - IMPROVED
**Problem:** Generic "Failed to fetch" errors weren't helpful

**Solution:**
- Better error messages with actual API responses
- "Check server is running" instructions
- Formatted multi-line error display

## How to Use

### 1. Start Server
```bash
cd /Users/matthewmauer/Desktop/CALOS_ROOT/agent-router
npm start
```

### 2. Open Dashboard
```bash
open http://localhost:5001/multi-model-research.html
```

Or manually navigate to: `http://localhost:5001/multi-model-research.html`

### 3. Try Example Queries

**Current Events (triggers web research):**
- "What pirate treasure was found in 2025?"
- "Latest AI developments"
- "Recent discoveries in Madagascar"

**Academic Topics (compares reasoning depth):**
- "Explain quantum computing"
- "How does blockchain work?"
- "What is machine learning?"

**Bias Detection:**
- "UFO sightings in 2025"
- "Conspiracy theories about AI"

### 4. Understand Results

The dashboard shows:

**Summary Card:**
- Models Compared (5)
- Total Time (15-30 seconds)
- Consensus (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Common Facts (agreement count)
- Best Model (with crown üëë)

**Model Cards (side-by-side):**
- Model name (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, etc.)
- Score (0-100 points)
- Confidence (%)
- Sources Used (count)
- Response Time (ms)
- Bias Score (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Reasoning Pattern (analytical-thorough, quick-conclusion, etc.)
- Answer (truncated)
- Sources (top 3 shown)

---

## Licensing Notice (Now Visible)

The dashboard now clearly shows:

### Model Licenses
- **GPT-4** ‚Üí OpenAI Terms of Service
- **Claude 3.5** ‚Üí Anthropic Commercial Terms
- **DeepSeek** ‚Üí DeepSeek API Terms
- **Qwen 2.5** ‚Üí Alibaba Tongyi Qianwen (Apache 2.0 compatible)
- **Llama 3.1** ‚Üí Meta Llama Community License

### Usage Notice
> Results are for **research and comparison purposes**. Commercial use requires compliance with each provider's license.
> Web scraping respects robots.txt and rate limits. All data stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM).

### Privacy Notice
- ‚úÖ All queries through **your own browser** (Puppeteer)
- ‚úÖ **No tracking** (Google Analytics, Facebook blocked)
- ‚úÖ **Rotating user agents** (appear as different browsers)
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted storage** (AES-256-GCM)
- ‚úÖ **Isolated browsing** (no cookies/history contamination)

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" Error

**If you still see this error:**

1. **Check server is running:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Should see: `Server running on http://localhost:5001`

2. **Check port 5001 is accessible:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/models/list
   ```
   Should return JSON with model list

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for CORS errors
   - Look for network errors

4. **Check route is mounted:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "initMultiModelRoutes" router.js
   ```
   Should see route initialization

### "Models not responding" Error

**If models fail to respond:**

1. **Check API keys are set:**
   ```bash
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   echo $DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Check Ollama is running (for Qwen/Llama):**
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```

3. **Check database connection:**
   - PostgreSQL should be running
   - Connection string in `.env`

### "Comparison timeout" Error

**If comparison takes too long:**

1. **Reduce models** (edit `lib/model-reasoning-comparator.js`):
   ```javascript
   models: [
     { provider: 'openai', model: 'gpt-4', name: 'GPT-4' },
     { provider: 'anthropic', model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', name: 'Claude 3.5' }
   ]
   ```

2. **Increase timeout** (default 60s per model):
   ```javascript
   timeout: 120000 // 120s
   ```

3. **Disable web research** (faster but less accurate):
   ```javascript
   enableWebResearch: false
   ```

## What This Is (Plain English)

Think of this like **Google AI Studio** or **Anthropic Console**, but with a twist:

1. **You enter a question**
   - Example: "What pirate treasure was found in 2025?"

2. **5 AI models research it simultaneously**
   - Each model searches the web (DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, news)
   - Each model extracts facts and sources
   - Each model gets analyzed for bias

3. **You see how they think differently**
   - GPT-4: Fast, uses Wikipedia, moderate confidence
   - Claude: Thorough, uses academic sources, high confidence
   - DeepSeek: Analytical, extracts numbers, logic-heavy
   - Qwen: Similar to GPT-4, prefers Wikipedia
   - Llama: Basic explanations, training-limited

4. **System picks the best answer**
   - Scored on confidence, sources, bias, speed, reasoning
   - Shows consensus (do all models agree?)
   - Shows reasoning transparency (every step logged)

**Use it for:**
- Research current events (2025 discoveries)
- Compare AI reasoning styles
- Detect biased sources
- Find the best model for your task

## API Endpoint (if you want to use it programmatically)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/models/compare \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What pirate treasure was found in 2025?"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "comparisonId": 42,
  "query": "What pirate treasure was found in 2025?",
  "models": [...],
  "analysis": {...},
  "consensus": {...},
  "bestModel": {...},
  "totalTime": 18532
}
```
