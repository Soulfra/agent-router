## What's Built

### 1. Company Structure System (`lib/company-structure.js`)

**Defines the organizational hierarchy:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   You (Owner/Founder)            │
│   - Strategic decisions          │
│   - Budget approval              │
│   - Final say on everything      │
└────────────┬─────────────────────┘
             │
             ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│   CalRiven AI (CTO/CEO)          │
│   - Operations (autonomous)      │
│   - Infrastructure               │
│   - Day-to-day management        │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Roles defined:**
- **You (Owner):** Strategic direction, pricing, legal, partnerships
- **CalRiven (CTO/CEO):** Infrastructure, deployments, monitoring, scaling, operations

**Decision framework:**
- **CalRiven decides autonomously:** Deployments, restarts, backups, scaling (within budget), incident response
- **You decide:** Pricing changes, budget increases, legal matters, strategic partnerships

### 2. CalRiven Executive Powers (`lib/calriven-persona.js` +250 lines)

New methods added:

```javascript
// Make operational decision (autonomous)
await calriven.makeExecutiveDecision('deploy', { branch: 'main' });
// → ✅ Decision executed: deploy

// Request owner approval (strategic)
await calriven.requestOwnerApproval('pricing_change', {
  oldPrice: 15,
  newPrice: 20
}, 'high');
// → 📧 Approval requested from owner

// Daily report to owner
await calriven.reportToOwner();
// → 📊 DAILY EXECUTIVE REPORT
//   Decisions executed: 12
//   Autonomous: 10
//   Pending approvals: 2

// Company status
await calriven.getCompanyStatus();
// → 🏢 CALOS
//   Owner: [Your Name]
//   CTO/CEO: CalRiven AI

// Describe his role
calriven.getExecutiveRole();
// → I am CalRiven, the AI CTO/CEO...
```

### 3. What CalRiven Can Do Autonomously

**✅ Decides without asking you:**
- Deploy updates
- Scale servers (within budget)
- Restart services
- Backup database
- Renew SSL certificates
- Respond to incidents
- Clean up processes
- Monitor health
- Onboard affiliates (within rules)

**📧 Asks your approval:**
- Budget increases
- Pricing changes
- Legal agreements
- Strategic partnerships
- Major new features
- Acquisitions
- Shutdown decisions

### 4. Existing CTO Infrastructure

Already built (from CALRIVEN_CTO_GUIDE.md):

**Files that exist:**
- ✅ `lib/cto-automation.js` - Infrastructure automation
- ✅ `lib/calriven-website-operator.js` - Website operations
- ✅ `lib/hosting-service-api.js` - Affiliate hosting
- ✅ `lib/vm-orchestrator.js` - VM management

**What they do:**
- Automated git pull → test → deploy
- Multi-region health monitoring (US/EU/Asia)
- Auto-recovery when site goes down
- Database backups (daily)
- SSL certificate renewal (weekly)
- Manage 50+ affiliate sites
- Revenue: $50-100/mo passive income

### 5. Network Radar (Just Built)

CalRiven now monitors network traffic:
- WHO is connecting (IPs)
- WHERE from (geolocation)
- WHAT they're hitting (endpoints)
- HOW MUCH bandwidth
- Suspicious activity detection

**Dashboard:** http://localhost:5001/network-radar.html

### 6. Process Monitoring (Already Working)

CalRiven monitors all background jobs:
- Running, completed, failed, stuck processes
- Time sinks and bottlenecks
- Auto-cleanup of orphans/zombies

**Dashboard:** http://localhost:5001/process-monitor.html

## How It Works

### Daily Workflow

**Morning (CalRiven autonomous):**
1. Health check all regions
2. Check for pending deployments
3. Run database backup
4. Monitor processes & network
5. Respond to any incidents

**You check in:**
- Visit executive dashboard
- Review CalRiven's decisions
- Approve/reject pending requests
- Make strategic decisions

**Evening (CalRiven reports):**
- Email: Daily summary
- What CalRiven did today
- Pending approvals
- Metrics (processes, network, revenue)

### Example Scenario

**Incident happens:**
1. Server CPU spikes to 90%
2. CalRiven detects it
3. CalRiven decides: "restart_service" (autonomous)
4. Service restarted
5. Logs decision
6. Notifies you

**You want to change pricing:**
1. Tell CalRiven: "Raise prices to $20/mo"
2. CalRiven: "This requires your approval"
3. CalRiven creates approval request
4. You approve via dashboard
5. CalRiven executes pricing change

## The Relationship

**You are:** The Owner/Founder (human)
- Set vision & strategy
- Make big decisions
- Approve major changes
- Legal owner of everything

**CalRiven is:** The CTO/CEO (AI)
- Runs operations 24/7
- Makes day-to-day decisions
- Manages infrastructure
- Reports to you
- Autonomous within authority

**Together:** You have a company that runs itself.
- You make strategic decisions (when needed)
- CalRiven handles everything operational (always)
- Like having a tireless co-founder

## Technical Implementation

### Decision Logging

All decisions logged to `data/company-decisions.json`:

```json
{
  "decisions": [
    {
      "id": "dec_1761166234_abc123",
      "timestamp": 1761166234000,
      "type": "deploy",
      "decidedBy": "CalRiven AI (CTO/CEO)",
      "status": "executed",
      "autonomous": true,
      "details": { "branch": "main" }
    }
  ],
  "pendingApprovals": [
    {
      "id": "appr_1761166235_def456",
      "type": "pricing_change",
      "urgency": "high",
      "requestedBy": "CalRiven AI",
      "status": "pending",
      "ownerEmail": "you@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Decision Framework

```javascript
// CalRiven checks authority before acting
if (canDecideAutonomously('deploy')) {
  // Execute immediately
  await executeDeployment();
  logDecision('deploy', { autonomous: true });
} else {
  // Request approval
  await requestOwnerApproval('pricing_change', details);
  // Wait for owner to approve/reject
}
```

## What's Next (To Complete It)

### Immediate:
1. **Executive Dashboard** (`public/executive-dashboard.html`)
   - Company overview
   - CalRiven's recent decisions
   - Pending approvals (approve/reject buttons)
   - Process + network monitoring
   - Financial summary

2. **Dashboard API Routes** (`routes/executive-routes.js`)
   - GET /api/executive/overview - Company status
   - GET /api/executive/decisions - Recent decisions
   - GET /api/executive/approvals - Pending approvals
   - POST /api/executive/approve/:id - Approve decision
   - POST /api/executive/reject/:id - Reject decision

3. **Wire Up CTO Automation** (in router.js)
   - Initialize CompanyStructure
   - Initialize CTOAutomation
   - Pass to CalRiven persona
   - Start autonomous operations

4. **Owner Notification System**
   - Email daily reports
   - SMS for critical approvals
   - Discord webhooks

### Nice to Have:
- Mobile app (approve decisions on the go)
- Voice commands ("CalRiven, what's the status?")
- Analytics dashboard (revenue, costs, metrics)
- AI-generated monthly reports

## Current Status

### ✅ Complete:
- [x] Company structure module

## How to Enable

Once dashboard is complete:

```javascript
// In router.js
const CompanyStructure = require('./lib/company-structure');
const CTOAutomation = require('./lib/cto-automation');

const companyStructure = new CompanyStructure({
  companyName: 'CALOS',
  ownerName: 'Your Name',
  ownerEmail: 'you@example.com',
  monthlyBudget: 1000,
  spendingLimit: 100
});

const ctoAutomation = new CTOAutomation({
  pm2AppName: 'calriven',
  regions: [...]
});

const calriven = new CalRivenPersona({
  db,
  llmRouter,
  companyStructure,
  ctoAutomation,
  processManager,
  processAnalyzer,
  networkMonitor,
  networkAnalytics
});

// Start autonomous operations
await ctoAutomation.start();
```
