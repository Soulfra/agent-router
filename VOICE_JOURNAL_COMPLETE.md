## What Was Built

A complete **daily voice-to-everything content pipeline** where you can:

1. **Talk daily like a podcast** into any of your brand domains
2. **Ramble freely** about ideas, dev work, math concepts, products
3. **Get coherent narratives** automatically (with story arcs, themes, insights)
4. **Extract actionable work** (dev tasks → GitHub issues, math → LaTeX notes, product ideas, research questions)
5. **Route content to brand domains** based on topic analysis
6. **Auto-publish everywhere** (Mastodon, blog, Twitter, YouTube, newsletter, podcast)
7. **Track daily streaks** with quest rewards

## Example Session

**9:00 AM - User records 20-minute voice journal**

```
"So I've been thinking about this privacy thing, like how data brokers are
just destroying people's privacy. What if we built something that actually
fought back? Like a zero-knowledge proof system where you could verify
your identity without exposing your data...

Oh and I should add authentication to that API endpoint, probably JWT tokens.

And there's this whole math thing with matrix multiplication that could
optimize the verification process...

You know what, this could actually be a SaaS. People would pay for privacy."
```

**9:05 AM - System processes automatically**

1. **Transcription** (Whisper API)
   - 20-minute audio → text transcript

## Troubleshooting Reference

### "Orchestrator not initialized"

Add to `router.js`:

```javascript
const voiceJournalRoutes = require('./routes/voice-journal-routes');
const DailyVoiceJournalOrchestrator = require('./lib/daily-voice-journal-orchestrator');

const voiceOrchestrator = new DailyVoiceJournalOrchestrator({
  db,
  llmRouter,
  questEngine,
  recordingOrchestrator,
  activityPubServer,
  contentPublisher
});

app.use('/api/voice-journal', voiceJournalRoutes);
voiceJournalRoutes.initOrchestrator(voiceOrchestrator);
```

### Platform not enabled

Check platform clients are configured in orchestrator options.

### Transcription failed

Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.

### GitHub issues not created

Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set with `repo` scope.
